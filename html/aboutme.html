        My name is Jose Granger Salgado and I am studying Computer Science and Technologies in the Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Santa Fe in Mexico City.
        Although I have lived in Mexico City for most of my life, I love going to new places and integrating with new cultures, as shown by my participation in exchange student programs. I love software and hardware development
        since I consider myself a creative person with a love for creating new things. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My hobbies are coding, reading, playing videogames and doing some sports. I am most passionate about the front-end side of development, though I still enjoy coding algorithms and various back-end products. My interests focus on developed on the web and on mobile, though I am
        always open to new experiences and methods.

    <div class="textColumn" style="color:white; font-size:20"> I value relationships and consider that teamwork is able to present a result that is more than the sum of its parts. Nevertheless I am highly adaptable, able to work both in big and small teams and solo, a task that had been made
    much easier with my understanding of Git and Github. <br><br>I have the perserverance to spend hours doing things I love and unraveling complex coding challenges, with ample skills to learn.
    having personal experience as a Team Lead, I can also organize the team, whilst hearing and integrating their opinions, resulting in a greater product. </a> </div>
